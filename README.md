This project focuses on implementing a fully functional login page using JavaScript, showcasing core concepts such as basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface with robust input validation and error handling for a seamless login experience. Below are the key features of the project:

Key Features
1. Dynamic User Interface (UI) with DOM Manipulation
The login page dynamically updates elements using JavaScript.
Real-time feedback is provided for user actions such as entering data in input fields or clicking buttons.
The form displays error messages or success indicators directly within the DOM without page reloads.
2. Interactive Event Handling
Implements event listeners for user interactions, such as:
Detecting input field focus and blur for enhanced user feedback.
Validating the form when the "Login" button is clicked.
Ensures that button clicks and keystrokes trigger appropriate validations.
3. Input Validation
Validates the login form inputs for completeness and correctness:
Username Validation: Ensures the field is not empty and meets specified criteria.
Password Validation: Checks for a minimum character requirement and presence of alphanumeric characters.
Displays detailed error messages, such as:
"Username is required."
"Password must be at least 8 characters long."
Prevents form submission if any validation errors occur.
4.Failure: Displays a message like "Invalid username or password."
5. Handling Invalid Inputs
Prevents submission of incomplete or invalid data by disabling the "Login" button until all fields are correctly filled.
Highlights empty or incorrectly filled fields with a red border and corresponding error messages.
Ensures secure handling of sensitive data, such as masking the password input.
6. Error Handling and Resilience
Displays user-friendly error messages for scenarios such as:
Missing username or password.
Invalid characters in the username or password.
Network issues or server downtime during authentication.
Provides retry options or alternative suggestions for resolving issues.
